# but-fit-projects

A cumulative repository for my finished university projects.

## Description

This repo contains only projects that I managed to code at least enough properly, in the time before deadline, to have any **value for the future students of Brno University of Technology**.

All `readme` files will be finished later in time... I've just had this repo sitting in an uncommitted state for over 6 months now, not being of use for anyone. Honestly? I'll probably forget about the unfinished readme files minutes after I push this, but I guess it's better to sit forgotten in an undocumented state, than in an uncommited state.
